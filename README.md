## Learn Git Branching 

- When I started this course I improved my knowledge about Git Branching.
- The most memorable command was ___"git fakeTeamwork"___ because for my opinion it was useful command.
- In future I will be able to use branches flexibly.

WOW, I finished one more course and I learned some information about Linux and Linux commands. 
It was my first experience with Linux, but it was not difficult.
In this course everything was new and interesting for me because I use Windows:) But maybe in future I will install Linux and will use it. And I will use my Linux skills.  


After completing course "Linux Survival" I learned and understood:
- How create a directory (mkdir)
- how change directory  (cd)
- how copy file (cp)
- how remove file (rm)
- how find file (find)
